  ***Description:*** Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics to generate highly realistic images by simulating the behavior of light in a scene. The technique involves tracing the path of light rays, and calculating how they are reflected, or absorbed by different materials.In a typical ray tracing algorithm, a virtual camera is placed in the scene, and rays are cast from the camera into the scene to see what objects and surfaces are visible. Followed the [wiki](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), I build a RayTracing from the most basic intersection algorithm of rays and geometric objects using Monte Carlo Methods.
